# PokemonDataAnalysis
Answering a few questions I always thought about Pokemon. Using Pandas and Tableau.


Q1: Which are the top 10 Pokemon being from Generation one to five, any type of Pokemon at any stage of evolution, non-legendary, their attack, defence and speed being greater than 100, finally their HP should be a minimum of 60. (Here the objective was to highlight only the strongest Pokemons of any type)

The whole purpose of such data analysis is to reveal insights which you will never expect! Pokemon names such as Celebi, Manaphy will be unknown to many as compared to Pikachu.

So now Ash Ketchum knows which Pokemon to keep high on his priority list.

Q2: The second objective is to define the strongest possible pokemon under the types of water and fire belonging to the classical generations of 1 to 3 where the Pokemon's strongness is defined by the average of their attack, defence, HP, special attack, special defence and speed.

Answering these questions became a bit complex as I had to be innovative towards my approach while deciding exactly how and which columns should be used or dropped from consideration. The creation of subsets and filters had to be in stages or else grasping particular parts of data would have been tricky.
Again this analysis gave me some very unique answers. The most famous and strongest Pokemons I ever knew under fire and water types were Blastoise and Charizard(having played it on Gameboy), but as I expanded the scope of the generation I entered unchartered territory and discovered one of the strongest Pokemon(s)- "Ho-oh" and "Primal Kyogre"

Q3: Objective
For a strategic Pokemon Trainer/ expert, teamwork is important. During a battle against an even better player, it is essential to create a buffer to wear down the opponent in order to predict their next move and Pokemon or manipulating the opponent by introducing "buffer pokemon(s). "
This term is something I came up with on my own and analysed my own gems in this mine of data. These pokemon hold an average strongness ( average of attack, defence, special attack, special defence, HP and speed ) of at least 75 and vary in Type, have different Speeds, different Attack and Defense capabilities.
This analysis also shows one of the most common buffer Pokemon: Water as a better approach(merely due to a greater number than any other), but I have tried to gather as many types as possible.

It also shows one of the most balanced buffer Pokemon - Phione .

If we'd wanna defend our position or gather more time we can use Torkoal(Fire) as it has the highest Defense value.

If we'd wanna attack to astonish our opponent with high Attack power Breloom(Grass) is the best option.

If we want the best variations, Pidgeot.

This variety gives us an upper hand in any battle alongside reliability to survive a tough encounter.
